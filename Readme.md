#### Usage
Create a color palette with local color styles. Be sure to structure your light and dark mode colors in seperate folders and that they are named identically (e.g. sys/light/primary and sys/dark/primary). This plugin works best with palettes generated with [Material Theme Builder](https://www.figma.com/community/plugin/1034969338659738588/Material-Theme-Builder) plugin which is provided by Google's Material Design team.

This plugin helps you to switch between light and dark mode afterwards.

1. Open your design library and select "Save document's color styles" once.
2. Navigate to the design document which contains your artboards with components from your design library.
3. Select the artboard or component you want to switch.
4. Navigate to the plugin menu and select "Switch to dark mode" or "Switch to light mode".

#### Optional
You can select "Show UI" to open a minimalistic plugin UI to switch themes via button.

ðŸ¥³ Have fun!
